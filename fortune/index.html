<h1>fortune(6) favors the fast: a novel method of selecting a random element from a list</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A list is defined as a linear collection of data that has a lookup time of
<code>O(n)</code>.
The algorithm shown below allows for a random element to be selected from
a list (represented here as a singly-linked list) in <code>O(n)</code> time without
knowing the length of the list beforehand.  This algorithm works equally
as well as other algorithms when the length of the list is known (<code>O(n)</code>),
but does not require two passes through the data when it is not.  The
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> game pairs well with this algorithm, as this algorithm
does not require any memory of past lines, save <code>save</code> (see below).</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> is an old UN*X game that, in its original implementation,
selected a random line from a file containing one-line fortunes (one per line)
and printing it to the console, thus acting roughly like a fortune cookie.
Since <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> reads lines from a file, the number of lines is not
known, and storing all of the lines could be prohibitive on the small-memory
systems it was developed on.  The presented algorithm allows for the random
selecting of a line in <code>O(n)</code> time without storing every line and without
knowing the number of lines.</p>
<p>This method of selecting a random element from a list is only more efficient
than the na&iuml;ve algorithm if the list has a <code>O(n)</code> lookup
time, so all of the code will be working on a singly-linked list <code>p</code>,</p>
<pre><code>struct list
{
  char val;
  struct list *next;
} *p;

/* abbreviate 'struct list' to 'list' */
typedef struct list list;
</code></pre>
<p>with the initial values of</p>
<pre><code>0, 1, 2, 3
</code></pre>
<p>and an unknown length.  (The na&iuml;ve algorithm has <code>O(1)</code> performance for a list
with an <code>O(1)</code> lookup time and a known length, as shown below.)</p>
<pre><code>extern int len,*array;

int index,save;

/* arrays have a lookup time of O(1) */
index = rand () % len;
save = array[index];
</code></pre>
<p>This operates by just grabbing a random index.</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2 3
    ^
</code></pre>
<p>Notably, this has <code>O(n)</code> runtime when the length is unknown or the list has
a lookup time of <code>O(n)</code>, both of which are common constraints, and requires
that the entire list be traversed twice if both are true.</p>
<pre><code>extern list *p;

list **head;
int index,save,len=0;

head=&amp;p;

/* get length of p */
while (p) {
  ++len;
  p=p-&gt;next;
}

p=&amp;head;

/* look familiar? */
index = rand () % len;

while (index--)
  p=p-&gt;next;

save=p-&gt;val;
</code></pre>
<p>The following
algorithm only requires one full traversal even when the length is unknown,
and only requires the storage of the current list element.</p>
<pre><code>extern list *p;

int index,save;

for (index=1; p; ++index,p=p-&gt;next)
  if (rand () % index == 0)
    save=p-&gt;val;
</code></pre>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Another way of approaching the problem is to consider shuffling the list, then
selecting the first element, thus selecting a random element.</p>
<p>This shifts the runtime to the shuffling algorithm, as selecting the first
element will be <code>O(1)</code> as long as the list is already on its first element.
(Note that this holds for any element, and the first is chosen mostly for
convenience).  A na&iuml;ve shuffling implementation would simply select pairs of
elements to swap for however many elements there are in the list, but this
results in a runtime of O(n&sup2;).</p>
<p>This can be simplified to the canonical Fischer-Yates, or Knuth, Shuffle, which
runs in <code>O(n)</code> time by moving down the list and swapping a random element with
the one currently addressed.  The major insight which allows it to be used in
the context of selecting a random line without keeping track of the entire
list is that only the first element needs to be checked for a swap, and since
elements previously addressed will never be swapped again, previous swaps can
effectively be ignored.</p>
<pre><code>Example Knuth Shuffle

0 1 2 3    from 0-3, roll 0
^     ^    swap index 3 and index 0

3 1 2 0    from 0-2, roll 1
  ^ ^      swap index 2 and index 1

3 2 1 0    from 0-1, roll 0
^ ^        swap index 0 and index 1

2 3 1 0    finished
</code></pre>
<h2>Fortune!</h2>
<p>With this, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> can be more efficiently implemented with this
algorithm, as <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> can simply read in an input
line, see what line it will swap with, and store it if the swapped line is the
first.</p>
<p>This works because if a line is swapped with something other than the
first line, it is irrelevant, and if it swaps with the first line, it becomes
the first line.  By keeping track of whatever is in the first line via a
storage variable (<code>save</code>) and checking if any of the lines swap with it via
the Knuth Shuffle, which is effectively just shuffling the list while ignoring
everything except the first element, which is equivalent to selecting a random
line out of a list, this algorithm allows for a significant improvement on the
na&iuml;ve &quot;get length, get random index, select element at index&quot; method.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this algorithm requires the random number
generator to be called for every element in the list, as opposed to the na&iuml;ve
algorithm only calling the random number generator once, but since
computers can almost always perform math faster than read from memory, this
tends to be a non-issue (including in
resource-constrained environments, as storing the entire list will likely be
more impairing in those environments than CPU time.
This algorithm allows for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fortune.6"><em>fortune(6)</em></a> to search through input file
in <code>O(n)</code> time without storing the content of those files, allowing for simple
and memory efficient implementations.</p>
