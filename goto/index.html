<h1>Goto is not Evil</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Everything in this article applies to modern,
high-level languages without control structures
that obsolesce goto.  If this does not apply, have
fun with your assembler or Oberon and don't worry
about the excessive or complete lack of gotos,
respectively.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Goto is a low-level feature
that is often misued and has gained a
reputation for obfuscating otherwise readable code
and causing difficult bugs.  When used for its
intended purpose, goto can be a powerful tool, but
is, at heart, a low-level feature and should be
treated with the caution that comes with that
territory.</p>
<h2>Goto is Everywhere (and Hopefully Nowhere)</h2>
<p>Goto is effectively an assembler <code>jmp</code>
instruction, and as such makes up 100% of the
control structures defining high-level programming
languages, e.g. an infinite loop.</p>
<p>In x86 assembler:</p>
<pre><code>loop:
  ; do things
  jmp loop
</code></pre>
<p>In C:</p>
<pre><code>for (;;) {
  ; do things
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, none of the complaints surrounding goto
concern its use in assembly: even debatees over
goto's inclusion in Algol 60 agreed it is
functional and useful in that area.  The complaints
mostly address goto being used to create or
recreate those control structures in a less
readable way, or threaten a usage in that manner.
In Dijkstra's famous paper 'Go To Statement
Considered Harmful', he discusses the difficulty
of mapping the code of a program to the program's
behavior at runtime, using a simple indexing
system.
He argues that the simplicity of the index directly
maps to the human programmer's ability to
understand the code, and while explicit structures
like simple loops (one index), functions (multiple
indexes, or even basic recursion (see functions)
do not severely impact the indexing system, the
goto statement requires a complete overhaul.
Using goto in lea of legitimate control structures
is thus a pretty bad idea, considering it greatly
reduces readability of the code and creates pain
for maintainers later, but it is not the only way
of using goto.</p>
<h2>Not Evil?</h2>
<p>There are however uses of goto that merely extend
existing language constructs, such as subprocedures
and multi-level breaks, and thus inherit the
parent-construct's understanding.</p>
<p>Since subprocedures act like a
procedure call (with inherited state), they
function the same index wise as functions, albeit
with a slightly less readable syntax in C.</p>
<pre><code>foo (error)
{
  if (error)
    goto fail;

fail:
  return -1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>For simple procedures with many failure states
but only one failure code, this model is more
elegant and aguably more readable than a series
of cascading if-statements or failure-checking
temporary variable in _<em>every condition</em>, and a
literal failure
procedure cannot be used if the original one must
return.</p>
<p>Goto can also cleanly be used for multi-level
breaks when those are not provided, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>int i, j;

for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i)
  for (j = 0; j &lt; 100; ++j)
    if (i != j)
      goto end;
end:
</code></pre>
<p>This could also be done structuraly via a state
variable,</p>
<pre><code>int i, j, end;

end = 0;

for (i = 0; i &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; !end; ++i)
  for (j = 0; j &lt; 100 &amp;&amp; !end; ++j)
    if (i != j)
      end = 1;
</code></pre>
<p>but this somewhat obfuscates the logic of the loop
with that of the multi-level break.  Note that
even goto-like statements like break and continue
are outlawed in pure structured programming as
defined in the BÃ¶hm-Jacopini Theorem, despite their
common acceptance in otherwise goto-free code.</p>
<p>As is shown, goto can easily create control flow
structures like subprocedures and multi-level
breaks when they are not provided by the language,
but is also ripe for abuse in recreating existing
control structures.</p>
<h2>100% Totally Not Evil</h2>
<p>When the Java programming language was created, one
of its design goals was to remove all of the
low-level features from C++ like direct memory
access, pointers, and the explicit jump
instruction.  Except they forgot the explicit jump
instruction, so goto persists in high-level
contexts in definitely shouldn't and hasn't in
other languages designed to be high-level like
ALGOL W, in <em>1966</em>.  While goto underlies all
control
structures and can used to create new ones in
incredibly specific
situations, there is absolutely no reason why a new
control structure would need to be invented in a
modern high-level language.  But this does not mean
that goto itself is evil.  Goto is inherently a
low-level construct used to create higher-level
ones, like subprocedures or multi-level breaks.
Goto is only harmful when it is used to recreate
existing
constructs.  Like any tool, goto is only useful
when it is used in the way it was intended, and
that case does not and should not
come up often in modern,
featureful languages.</p>
